  Using the "file_<NUMBER>" keys, you can refer to files in the "files" library folder. The file replacer in the script will be replaced by the full path to it. This may avoid problems when using the library on other hosts.

  For a better understanding of what is going on it is recommended to look at the file "bashmator/library/modules/examples/6_files.yaml" and at the "bashmator/library/files" directory.
