  To make the argument multiple, add the "multiple: true" key. 
  The properties of multiple arguments are specified with the "mode" key (by default, the values are joined with a space)

  For a better understanding of what is going on it is recommended to look at the file "bashmator/library/modules/examples/4_multiple.yaml".
