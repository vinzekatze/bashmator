  Using the "item_<NUMBER>" keys, you can specify additional scripts. For each script, the "mode" and "shell" keys can be overridden. Together with items it is also possible to use the main script, which will run by default. Each item uses the main "mode" and "shell" settings if they have not been specified.

  For a better understanding of what is going on it is recommended to look at the file "bashmator/library/modules/examples/7_items.yaml".
